# @archway/html

It's like JSX... but with functions. Using the built-in `arch` function shipped with the archway-framework can be tedious, so we've bundled together all of the existing html tags to make development a bit easier.

## Installation

```console
archway@ubuntu:~$ npm i @archway/html
```
